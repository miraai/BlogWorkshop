				<p>It's finally here! Well, sort of. Ubisoft has taken the wraps off of the long-awaited Beyond Good and Evil 2. Here's everything you need to know.</p>

				<p>Beyond Good and Evil is about as ‘cult classic’ as gaming gets. The PS2 and Xbox original remains a fan-favourite 14 years since its 2003 launch. Beyond Good and Evil 2 was announced with a brief teaser in 2008, before immediately fading into obscurity, joining the likes of Half-Life 3 and, until recently, The Last Guardian, with no sign of a release date, gameplay or any hint of the ability to pre-order the game.</p>

				<h2>What is Beyond Good and Evil 2?</h2>

				<p>Despite the name, Beyond Good and Evil 2 is actually a prequel to the original Beyond Good and Evil.

We don't have a huge amount of detail on the actual storyline of the game, but the cinematic trailer shown off at Ubisoft's E3 press conference certainly whets our appetites for a bonkers romp through System 3, with a hugely diverse range of character designs, personalities, buildings and vehicles.</p>

				<p>"System 3 has become the center of interstellar trade and colonization in the Milky Way of the 24th century, thanks to the creation of Hybrid slaves. While private enterprises fight over resources and power, the first colonists weave together the rich and diverse spiritual and cultural heritages of Old Earth to give meaning to their existence. In this new era of piracy, we will rise from lowly pirate to legendary captain at the helm of massive star-faring vessels, adventuring alongside crews of colorful characters to fight for freedom and the right to determine our own fate among the stars!"</p>

				
				<p>The world looks richly detailed, with a highly religious theme with age-old temples combined with huge high-rises, and green space overseen by hulking police ships. Beyond the cities, you'll see lush countryside, huge mountains and you'll even be able to fly into space without any loading screens. The trailers below set up the game's tone pretty well; a swashbuckling adventure with lots of cheek and charm, set inside a large spaceship that acts as your home base.

On your ship, each member of your crew has their own purpose and talents.

There's the hint of an artefact that the player will have to find, perhaps some sort of super weapon. And that's about all we have.</p>
